    <h4 style = "margin-left : 20px;"> AIM </h4> 
    <p>
    
    I.To determine the rate of heat transfer, log mean temperature difference (LMTD) and overall heat transfer coefficient in the shell and tube heat exchanger.
<br/>
    II.Compute the inside and outside film heat transfer coefficients.
    </p>
    
    <h4 style = "margin-left : 20px;"> THEORY AND EXPERIMENTAL SETUP </h4>
    <p>
    
    The heat exchanger is a device used to transfer heat from one fluid to another, which is at
different temperatures. It is used in almost all chemical process industries. There are various
types of heat exchangers used in the process industry, such as shell–and–tube, parallel tube
with co–flow and counter–flow configurations, finned tube, plate and frame, helical and spiral
heat exchangers etc. Shell and tube heat exchanger consists of a tube bundle, which is inserted
in a shell. It is used when required heat transfer area is more than 10-20 m 2 . One fluid flows in
the tube and another in shell. Here the flow pattern may be either parallel flow pattern or as
counter flow pattern, but the current apparatus has counter flow pattern.
Temperatures are measured with the help of thermocouples. Readings are recorded when
steady state is reached. The shell is provided with adequate insulation to check heat loss. The
present experimental setup for shell and tube heat exchanger experiment consists of the
following components:
1. Main frame
2. Shell and tube heat exchanger
3. Temperature indicators and sensors
4. Hot water generator
5. Rotameters for hot and cold water flow rate measurements.
Hot fluid is hot water, which is heated with the help of heater fitted in the tank and circulated
with the help of magnetic drive pump. Cold water flows in the inner tube and hot water flows
in the shell. Different valves are provided in the system to regulate the flow rate of liquid.
Water tank is fitted with heater and digital temperature controller.Temperatures and flow rateswere measured at inlets and outlets for both tube and shell sides of the heat exchangers. The
schematic diagram of the apparatus is shown in Figure.

  <h4 style = "margin-left : 20px;"> EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE </h4> 
    <p>
    
    I.Fill water bath 3⁄4 with clean water and switch ON pump to circulate water. Once water
flow is continuous, switch ON the heaters.
<br/>
    II.Adjust the required temperature of hot water using Digital Temperature Controller
(DTC) (i.e., around 55 0 C to 60 0 C) in the water bath and maintain the hot water
temperature at a constant value throughout the experiment, either at 55 0 C or 60 0 C.
<br/>
    III.Once the temperature of the hot water has reached the required value, start the flow of
water through both hot and cold water side and maintain the constant flow rate of hot
water in the shell side and cold water flow rate may vary.
    <br/>
    IV.Once the flow gets stabilized in both hot and cold side record the temperature and
flow rate readings.
    <br/>
    V.Change the flow rates of cold water, wait for steady state, and note down another set
of readings. In this way, take 6-7 readings at different flow rates of cold water, while
keeping the hot water flow rate constant.
    <br/>
VI.Now, change the temperature or flow rate of hot water and repeat steps iii-iv.

<h4 style = "margin-left : 20px;"> PRECAUTIONS </h4> 
    <p>
    
    I. Do not put on heater unless water flow is continuous.</br>   
    II. Once the flow is fixed, do not change it until you note down the readings for that flow.</br>
    III. Thermocouple should be kept in pockets.</br>
    IV. Once the experiment is completed, drain out the water from both the tubes.</br>
