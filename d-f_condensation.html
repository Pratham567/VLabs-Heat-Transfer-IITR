        <h3 style = "margin-left : 20px;"> AIM </h3>
        <p>

            I. To have a visual observation of filmwise and dropwise condensation.
            <br/>
            II. To determine overall heat transfer coefficients in both filmwise and dropwise
            condensation both experimentally as well as theoretically.
        </p>

        <h3 style = "margin-left : 20px;"> THEORY </h3>
        <p>

            In all process, the steam must condense as it transfers heat to a cooling medium, e.g. cold
            water in condenser of a generating station, hot water in a heating calorimeter etc. during
            condensation very high heat fluxes are possible and provided the heat can quickly be
            transferred from the condensing surface to cooling medium, heat exchangers using steam
            can be compact and effective.
                    Steam condenses on surface by two types: 'filmwise' and 'dropwise'. For the same
            temperature difference between steam and surface dropwise condensation is more effective
            than filmwise condensation.

        <h3><small>(i)</small> Filmwise condensation:</h3>
                    Most materials are wettable and as condensation occurs a film condensate spreads over the
            surface. The thickness of film depends upon a number of factors like rate of condensation,
                    the viscosity of condensate and whether surface is horizontal or vertical. Fresh vapor
            condenses on outside of film and heat is transferred by conduction through the film to the
            metal surface beneath. As the film thickness increases, it flows downwards and dips from
            lowest point, leaving the film intact. The film of liquid is a barrier to the transfer of heat and
            its resistance accounts for most of the difference between the effectiveness of filmwise and
            dropwise condensation.

        <h3><small>(ii)</small> Dropwise condensation:</h3>
                    By specialy treating the condenser surface, the contact angle can be changed and surface
            become non- wettable. As steam condenses, a large number of beads cover the surface. As
            condensation proceeds the beads become larger, coalesces and strikes downward over the
            surface. The moving beads gather all static beads along with it in its downwardspath in its
            trail. The bare surface offers very little resistance to the transfer of heat and very high heat
            fluxes are possible. Unfortunately, due to the nature of material used in the construction of
            condenses, filmwise condensation is normal
                </p>

        <h3 style = "margin-left : 20px;"> EXPERIMENTAL SETUP SCHEMATIC AND DESCRIPTION </h3>
        <p>
            The apparatus consists of a vertical frame. Condensation tubes are fitted inside compact glass
            cylinder. The steam is provided in the cylinder from a steam generator. Two valves are fitted
            to control flow rate of water in individual tubes. Digital temperature indicators are used to
            monitor the temperatures at different locations in the experimental setup. A Digital
            Temperature Controller is provided for controlling temperature of steam. Pressure gauge is
            used to observe steam pressure and a rotameter is used to measure the cold water flow rate.
                    Water Level Indicator(not shown) is provided to safeguard the heater. Condensate is
            measured using a measuring cylinder after the completion of the experiment.

    <p>

            in level indicator.</li>
        <li> Switch ON the main supply.</li>
        <li> Set the required steam temperature with the help of DTC, above 100&#8451;.</li>
        <li> Switch ON the heater and wait until the steam temperature reaches to the required value.</li>
        <li> Ensure that wet steam vent valve(V<sub>1</sub> )and gate valve(V<sub>2</sub> )provided at the front are closed.</li>
        <li> Allow steam to pass through the pipe and slowly open wet steam vent valve(V<sub>1</sub> )to
            release wet steam from the pipe.</li>
        <li> Close the vent valve(V<sub>1</sub> ).</li>
        <li> Connect cooling water supply.</li>
        <li> Open the valve (V<sub>3</sub> ) or (V<sub>4</sub> ) to allow cooling water to flow through the desired condenser
            (Ensure that during experiment, water is flowing only through the condenser under test
            and the second valve is closed).</li>
        <li> Set the flow rate of cooling water by Rotameter.</li>
        <li> Open the gate valve(V<sub>2</sub> ) to allow steam to enter in the test section and start the stop
            watch to measure mass of steam condensed.</li>
        <li> Observe the steam that gets condensed on the tubes, and falls down in the glass cylinder
            (Depending upon the type of condenser under test i.e. Dropwise or Filmwise
            condensation).</li>
        <li> After reaching the steady state, record the temperature, flow rate of cooling water and
            steam pressure.</li>
        <li> Stop the steam supply to the column with the help of gate valve(V<sub>2</sub> ) and stop the stop
            watch and open the drain valve(V<sub>5</sub> ) of the glass chamber to measure the condensate in
            a particular time.</li>
